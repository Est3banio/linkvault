### User Management

**Important**: LinkVault uses invitation-only registration. Public sign-up is disabled for security and control.

#### Admin Dashboard

LinkVault includes a complete admin dashboard for comprehensive user management. Admin users can:

- **View all registered users** with detailed information
- **Create new user accounts** with email/password
- **Edit existing user information** and update permissions
- **Delete user accounts** (with protection - admins cannot delete their own account)
- **Grant or revoke admin privileges** for other users
- **Monitor user activity** and account status

**Access Requirements:**
- Must be logged in as an admin user
- Admin privileges are managed via the `admin` boolean field in the user model

**Navigation:**
1. Log in as an admin user
2. Click the "Admin" link in the top navigation (only visible to admins)
3. Access the full user management interface at `/admin/users`

**Admin Routes:**
- `/admin/users` - List all users
- `/admin/users/new` - Create new user
- `/admin/users/:id/edit` - Edit user details
- `/admin/users/:id` - View/delete user (with confirmation)

#### Creating Users

**Option 1: Admin Dashboard (Recommended)**
- Log in as an admin user
- Navigate to Admin ‚Üí Users
- Click "Create New User"
- Fill in email, password, and admin privileges

**Option 2: Rails Console**
```bash
# Start the Rails console
rails console

# Create a regular user
User.create!(email: "user@example.com", password: "password123", password_confirmation: "password123")

# Create an admin user
User.create!(email: "admin@example.com", password: "admin123456", password_confirmation: "admin123456", admin: true)

# Verify the user was created
User.count
```

**Option 3: Database Seeds**
Run `rails db:seed` to create default admin and user accounts:
- Admin: `admin@linkvault.local` / `admin123456`
- User: `user@linkvault.local` / `user123456`

#### User Registration Policy

- Public sign-up routes (`/users/sign_up`) are disabled
- Only administrators can create new user accounts via admin dashboard or console
- Existing users can log in normally at `/users/sign_in`
- Password reset functionality remains available for existing users

4. **Add tags and description** as needed
5. **Save immediately** to your LinkVault

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
rails test
```

## Deployment

### Docker

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: This Docker setup requires a PostgreSQL database. You'll need to run a PostgreSQL container or connect to an external database.

You can run the application in a Docker container:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t linkvault .

# Option 1: Run with environment variables
export RAILS_MASTER_KEY=$(cat config/master.key)
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:5432/linkvault_production"
docker run -d -p 3000:80 \
  -e RAILS_MASTER_KEY="$RAILS_MASTER_KEY" \
  -e DATABASE_URL="$DATABASE_URL" \
  --name linkvault linkvault

# Option 2: create a .env file with your keys and secrets
docker run -d -p 3000:80 --env-file .env --name linkvault linkvault
```

**Getting RAILS_MASTER_KEY**: The master key is located in `config/master.key` (not committed to git for security). For new deployments, generate one with `rails credentials:edit` or `bin/rails secret`.

For a complete development setup with database included, see the docker-compose.yml section below.

For a containerized development environment, see [Dev Containers](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started_with_devcontainer.html).

### Docker Compose (Development)

For local development with a database included, create a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: linkvault_development
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:password@db:5432/linkvault_development
      RAILS_MASTER_KEY: your_master_key_here
    depends_on:
      - db
    volumes:
      - .:/rails

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

Then run: `docker-compose up`

### Kamal

The application can also be deployed using Kamal:

```bash
./bin/kamal setup
./bin/kamal deploy
```
