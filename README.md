## Documentation

For comprehensive documentation, see the [`docs/`](docs/) folder:

- [Architecture Overview](docs/architecture.md) - System design and components
- [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md) - Docker, Kamal, and production setup
- [Contributing Guidelines](docs/contribution.md) - Development workflow and standards
- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) - Project history and releases

## Development

For local development, the project uses:

- Solid Queue for background job processing
- Ruby's built-in testing framework
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- GitLab CI/CD for automated testing and deployment

### CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitLab CI/CD for continuous integration and deployment. The pipeline includes:

- Automated testing on every commit
- Code quality checks with RuboCop
- Security scanning with Brakeman
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Automated deployment to staging/production environments

See `.gitlab-ci.yml` for the complete pipeline configuration.

### User Management

**Important**: LinkVault uses invitation-only registration. Public sign-up is disabled for security and control.

#### Creating Users via Console

Since public registration is disabled, new users must be created manually via the Rails console:

```bash
# Start the Rails console
rails console

# Create a new user (adjust email and password as needed)
User.create!(email: "user@example.com", password: "password123", password_confirmation: "password123")

# Verify the user was created
User.count
```

#### User Registration Policy

- Public sign-up routes (`/users/sign_up`) are disabled
- Only administrators can create new user accounts
- Existing users can log in normally at `/users/sign_in`
- Password reset functionality remains available for existing users

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
rails test
```

## Deployment

### Docker

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: This Docker setup requires a PostgreSQL database. You'll need to run a PostgreSQL container or connect to an external database.

You can run the application in a Docker container:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t linkvault .

# Option 1: Run with environment variables
export RAILS_MASTER_KEY=$(cat config/master.key)
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:5432/linkvault_production"
docker run -d -p 3000:80 \
  -e RAILS_MASTER_KEY="$RAILS_MASTER_KEY" \
  -e DATABASE_URL="$DATABASE_URL" \
  --name linkvault linkvault

# Option 2: create a .env file with your keys and secrets
docker run -d -p 3000:80 --env-file .env --name linkvault linkvault
```

**Getting RAILS_MASTER_KEY**: The master key is located in `config/master.key` (not committed to git for security). For new deployments, generate one with `rails credentials:edit` or `bin/rails secret`.

For a complete development setup with database included, see the docker-compose.yml section below.

For a containerized development environment, see [Dev Containers](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started_with_devcontainer.html).

### Docker Compose (Development)

For local development with a database included, create a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: linkvault_development
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:password@db:5432/linkvault_development
      RAILS_MASTER_KEY: your_master_key_here
    depends_on:
      - db
    volumes:
      - .:/rails

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

Then run: `docker-compose up`

### Kamal

The application can also be deployed using Kamal:

```bash
./bin/kamal setup
./bin/kamal deploy
```
