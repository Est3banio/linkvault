## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Keep your installation updated** to the latest supported version
- **Use strong passwords** for user accounts
- **Enable HTTPS/SSL** in production environments
- **Regularly review user access** and remove unused accounts
- **Monitor application logs** for suspicious activity
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
